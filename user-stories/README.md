# Airbnb Clone Backend User Stories

## Context
- These user stories are based on the use case diagram in `use-case-diagram/airbnb_clone_use_case.png`, which visualizes interactions between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and the system.
- The stories align with the database schema and sample data in `database-script-0x02/`, ensuring realistic scenarios (e.g., guests booking properties, hosts managing listings).
- The backend supports these interactions through the schema defined in `schema.sql` and populated by `seed.sql`.
